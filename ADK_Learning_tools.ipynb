Parking on weekends is typically free on campus.\n\n*   **10:00 AM - 1:00 PM: Cantor Arts Center & Rodin Sculpture Garden**\n    *   Begin at the **Cantor Arts Center**, which is always free to enter and open on Sundays from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.. Explore its diverse collection spanning various periods and cultures, from ancient China to the 21st century.\n    *   Step outside into the enchanting **Rodin Sculpture Garden**, where you can stroll among a large collection of Auguste Rodin's masterpieces in a tranquil outdoor setting. This offers a perfect blend of art appreciation and relaxation.\n*   **1:00 PM - 1:30 PM: Anderson Collection at Stanford University**\n    *   Adjacent to the Cantor Arts Center is the **Anderson Collection at Stanford University**, also with free admission and open on Sundays from 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.. This museum features an outstanding collection of modern and contemporary American art, providing a contrasting yet equally engaging artistic experience.\n\n### **Lunch (1:30 PM - 2:30 PM): Affordable Bites**\n\nAfter soaking in the art at Stanford, head towards San Jose for your next artsy stop. Along the way, or once you reach San Jose, there are plenty of affordable options.\n\n*   **Suggestion:** Grab a quick and tasty meal. San Jose's Japantown, your next destination, has many authentic and affordable eateries. Alternatively, for a highly-rated and inexpensive option, consider **Madras Café** in Sunnyvale, known for its delicious and affordable dosas. Many excellent and cheap Mexican food trucks can also be found in Sunnyvale and the surrounding areas.\n\n### **Afternoon (2:30 PM - 5:30 PM): Explore San Jose Japantown**\n\nSan Jose Japantown is one of the last three historic Japantowns in the United States, offering a unique blend of culture, history, and art.\n\n*   **2:30 PM - 5:00 PM: Walk and Discover**\n    *   Wander through **San Jose Japantown**, exploring its eclectic boutiques, traditional shops, and several art galleries like the Art Object Gallery and Empire Seven Studios. The neighborhood itself is a canvas of cultural expression.\n    *   Consider engaging with the **\"Hidden Histories of San Jose Japantown\"** – an augmented reality (AR) art experience that uses your mobile device to bring the neighborhood's rich history to life through art installations. This is a free and interactive way to experience art and history.\n*   **5:00 PM - 5:30 PM: Relax at a Local Cafe**\n    *   Find a cozy spot in Japantown for a relaxing coffee or tea, soaking in the unique atmosphere of the neighborhood.\n\n### **Evening (6:00 PM onwards): Affordable Dinner & Reflection**\n\nConclude your day with a relaxed and affordable dinner.\n\n*   **Suggestion:** Enjoy dinner at one of Japantown's authentic eateries, offering a range of Japanese cuisine at various price points. If you prefer to head back towards Sunnyvale, the **Madras Café** (mentioned earlier) or a local Mexican food truck remains a great choice for an inexpensive and satisfying meal.\n\nEnjoy your relaxing and artsy day trip!"
