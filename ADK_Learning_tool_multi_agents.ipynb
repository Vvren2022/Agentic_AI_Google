While outdoor concerts might be less common in some Northern Hemisphere locations due to winter, there are exciting festivals and shows in warmer climates and even some unique winter outdoor events.\n\nHere are a few \"cool\" outdoor concerts and festivals happening this weekend:\n\n**International Highlights:**\n\n*   **Milk + Cookies Johannesburg** in Johannesburg, South Africa, on Saturday, January 10th. This one-day festival features artists such as Gunna, Majid Jordan, and Elmiene.\n*   **Closer to the Sun** in Puerto Aventuras, Mexico, running from January 10th to 13th. The lineup includes Rebelution, Dirty Heads, and Slightly Stoopid.\n*   **Day Zero Tulum** in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, on Saturday, January 10th, promises a transformative experience in the mystical jungles of Tulum with artists like Acid Pauli, Cinthie, and Damian Lazarus.\n*   **Ocean Sounds Festival** in Newhaven, Victoria, Australia, on Saturday, January 10th, features The Teskey Brothers, The Presets, and Thelma Plum.\n*   **Insônia Festival** in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, takes place on January 10th and 11th, with performances by Shanti People, Major7, and Becker.\n*   The **Kirstenbosch Summer Sunset Concerts** in Cape Town, South Africa, are an ongoing series. While not part of the main series, Calum Scott will be performing outdoors on January 14, 2026.\n\n**United States Highlights:**\n\n*   **FYA Fest** in Orlando, Florida, will be held on January 10th and 11th, featuring bands like Hatebreed, Drain, and Gorilla Biscuits.\n*   The **Everglades Roots Festival 2026** in Ochopee, Florida, is scheduled from January 9th to 11th.\n*   In Winter Park, Colorado, there's a **FREE concert with Big Gigantic** at the Rendezvous Event Center on Saturday, January 10th, from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, followed by fireworks. Lizzy Jane is also scheduled to perform. Please note that this event is currently sold out, but it's advisable to check for any additional ticket releases.\n*   The **South Beach Jazz Festival** in Miami Beach, Florida, runs from January 8th to 11th. Specifically, the Spanish Harlem Orchestra with special guest Etienne Charles will perform on Saturday, January 10th, from 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM at the Miami Beach Bandshell. On Sunday, January 11th, the Lemon City Trio will perform at 1111 Lincoln Road from 12:45 PM to 1:45 PM.\n*   **Garden AMP** in Garden Grove, California, is hosting a tribute event on Saturday, January 10th, 2026, featuring tributes to My Chemical Romance, Paramore, and Misfits, along with Finding Emo - Taste The Khaos.\n*   For those in the Northeast, The Stone Pony in Asbury Park, New Jersey, is hosting **Slippery When Wet NJ (Bon Jovi Tribute)** on Friday, January 9th. While The Stone Pony is known for its outdoor Summer Stage, the specific calendar entry for this event does not explicitly state it is outdoors.\n\nSince \"cool\" can be subjective and location is a key factor for outdoor events, please let me know your preferred location, and I can try to find more tailored recommendations for you!"

While it is consistently referred to as being in \"Palo Alto\" and offering \"modern sushi omakase\", a specific numerical street address was not explicitly listed in my search results.\n\nTherefore, while I can confidently recommend **Iki Omakase** for an exceptional sushi experience, you will need to verify their exact address directly (perhaps through their reservation platform or by contacting them) to get the most accurate directions from the Caltrain station."
